# 👋 Hey, I'm Thomas Queste

## Who am I?

I'm a **developer**, and I build **products**.

Since pre-2000, I've been turning lines of code into rewarding creations,
  awkward bugs, and unexpected dance parties when the code finally works! 🎉

## Highlights

- Running my own company since 2013
- Founded three startups
- Quick transition from idea to execution — I call it Extreme Pragmatism (Better to have a database in a JSON file than fancy slides)
- Certified in Java, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB, but also Finance
- Beginner in Machine Learning (classification, Learning-to-Rank, Deep learning...)

## Fun Facts

- In 1999, my first website was fully designed with HTML tables (didn't know about divs!)
- I enjoy running and riding bicycles in all weather, from -15°C to 40°C
- As a minimalist, I've been running in zero drop shoes since 2008 (proud owner of Xero shoes)
